# FCoTFL
This repository provides a framework for **FCoTFL: Formal Chain-of-Thought prompting for Software Fault localization** using Large Language Models (LLMs).   It integrates several benchmark datasets (Defects4J, QuixBugs, and an unseen dataset), formal specifications (SOFL), and prompt-based LLM workflows.
