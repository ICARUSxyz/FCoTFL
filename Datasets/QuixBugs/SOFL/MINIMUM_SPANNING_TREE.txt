Pre/Post Specification：
module MINIMUM_SPANNING_TREE
type 
    weightedEdges: set of WeightedEdge
    mst: set of WeightedEdge

process minimum_spanning_tree(weightedEdges: set of WeightedEdge) mst: set of WeightedEdge
pre  
    weightedEdges ≠ ∅ ∧ ∀ e ∈ weightedEdges • e.weight ≥ 0
post 
    mst is a subset of weightedEdges ∧
    mst connects all vertices ∧
    mst contains no cycles ∧
    total_weight(mst) is minimal among all such subsets
