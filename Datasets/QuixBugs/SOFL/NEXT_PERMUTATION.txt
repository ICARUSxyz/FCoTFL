Pre/Post Specification：

type 
    perm: sequence of int
    next_perm: sequence of int

process next_permutation(perm: sequence of int) next_perm: sequence of int
pre  
    perm ≠ ⟨⟩
post 
    if perm is the largest permutation in lexicographic order then 
        next_perm = ⟨⟩
    else 
        next_perm is the smallest permutation greater than perm in lexicographic order
