Pre/Post Specification:
module KNAPSACK
type 
    capacity: int
    items: sequence of (int, int)
    max_value: int
process knapsack(capacity: int, items: sequence of (int, int)) max_value: int
pre  
    capacity ≥ 0 ∧ (∀i ∈ items • i.1 ≥ 0 ∧ i.2 ≥ 0)
post 
    max_value = the maximum total value achievable by selecting a subset of items whose total weight ≤ capacity

Functional Scenario Form (FSF Specification):
module KNAPSACK
type 
    capacity: int
    items: sequence of (int, int)
    max_value: int
process knapsack(capacity: int, items: sequence of (int, int)) max_value: int
Functional Scenario Form 
(capacity ≥ 0 ∧ ∀i ∈ items • i.1 ≥ 0 ∧ i.2 ≥ 0) &&
(max_value equals the highest possible sum of values of a subset of items such that the sum of their weights ≤ capacity)
