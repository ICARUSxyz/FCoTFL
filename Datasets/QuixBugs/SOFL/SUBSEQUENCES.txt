Pre/Post Specification：
module SUBSEQUENCES
type 
    a: int
    b: int
    k: int
    subseqs: sequence of sequence of int

process subsequences(a: int, b: int, k: int) subseqs: sequence of sequence of int
pre  
    a ≤ b ∧ k ≥ 0 ∧ (b−a+1) ≥ k
post 
    subseqs contains all increasing sequences of length k formed from distinct integers in [a..b]
