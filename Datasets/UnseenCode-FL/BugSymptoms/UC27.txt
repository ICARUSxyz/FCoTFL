**Bug Report: Issues Observed During File Initialization and Syntax Highlighting in MdiChild**

---

**Test Case 1: Syntax Highlighting Initialization**

**Action:**
Open a document window and check whether syntax highlighting is applied.

**Expected:**
Syntax highlighting should be active immediately upon opening the document.

**Observed:**
Highlighting does not appear until after manual text modification.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[DEBUG] Creating MdiChild
[INFO] Highlighter instance created
[WARN] Highlighting not applied on initial load
```

**Test Case 2: File Naming in New Document**

**Action:**
Create a new file without providing a filename.

**Expected:**
File should be named `document1.txt`, `document2.txt`, etc., incrementing with each new document.

**Observed:**
New documents always named `document1.txt`, sequence number not increasing.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[CALL] newFile("")
[INFO] Generated filename: document1.txt
[CALL] newFile("")
[INFO] Generated filename: document1.txt
```

---

**Test Case 3: Filename Placeholder Not Replaced**

**Action:**
Create new file with default naming logic.

**Expected:**
Filename should be rendered as `document1.txt`, not `document%1.txt`.

**Observed:**
Filename displays literal `%1` instead of a number.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[CALL] newFile("")
[WARN] Filename generated: document%1.txt
[UI] Window title: document%1.txt[*]
```
