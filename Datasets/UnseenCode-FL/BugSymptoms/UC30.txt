**Bug Report: VideoRecorder Functionality Issues**

---

**Test Case 1: Immediate Termination on Object Destruction**

**Action:**
Create and immediately destroy a `VideoRecorder` instance.

**Expected:**
No recording starts or stops unexpectedly.

**Observed:**
`stopRecording()` is triggered during destruction even though recording was never started.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[DEBUG] VideoRecorder destructor called  
[INFO] Attempting to stop recording...  
[ERROR] No ongoing recording to stop.
```

**Test Case 2: File Naming Issue**

**Action:**
Start a recording session.

**Expected:**
File is created with `.mp4` extension.

**Observed:**
File is saved with incorrect name, missing file extension.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Recording started. Saving to: video_20250808mp4  
[WARN] File extension may be malformed
```

**Test Case 3: Frame Rate Simulation**

**Action:**
Observe simulated frame rate during recording loop.

**Expected:**
Frames written approximately every 33ms (30fps).

**Observed:**
Delay is shorter than expected, causing frame overflow.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Writing frame at 30ms interval  
[DEBUG] Frame timestamps too dense; expected 33ms
```

**Test Case 4: Output Stream Error on Stop**

**Action:**
Stop a recording session.

**Expected:**
Recording stops and path is printed correctly.

**Observed:**
Error in printing output due to malformed stream output expression.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Recording stopped. File saved at: video_20250808.mp4std:endl;
[ERROR] Unexpected characters in log output
```
