// Test Case 1: Long period of inactivity
→ Simulated log:
[INFO] Initializing client...
[WARN] lost heartbeat.
[ERROR] Connection lost due to inactivity.
// The heartbeat timeout appears too aggressive; connection is closed unexpectedly even under normal pause.

// Test Case 2: Receiving partial socket data
→ Simulated input: Two consecutive socket buffers arriving, but partial
→ Expected: Buffer concatenated, complete message reconstructed
→ Actual: [TypeError] buf.copy is not a function or copy target misaligned
// Buffer copy operation fails or results in corrupted message assembly due to invalid buffer handling.

// Test Case 3: Message with declared length equal to buffer length
→ Simulated input: Buffer with 20 bytes, message header declares length = 20
→ Expected: Message processed
→ Actual: Message ignored, loop breaks prematurely
// Message never enters processing loop even though it’s complete.

// Test Case 4: Message parsing with unexpected `msgtype`
→ Simulated input: Header bytes → 00 00 00 20 01 00 00 00
→ Expected msgtype = 1
→ Actual msgtype = 16777216 (shifted value)
// Message type interpreted incorrectly due to wrong offset in `readInt32LE`.
