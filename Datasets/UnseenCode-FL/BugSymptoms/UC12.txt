Bug Report: ChatgptClient

Test Case:

```cpp
ChatgptClient client;
client.sendUserMessage("Hello, who are you?");
```

Observed Behavior:

* Application compiles but fails at runtime when making request to OpenAI API.

Expected Behavior:

* Sends user input to OpenAI API and receives a valid response from ChatGPT.
* Updates `chatgptReply` correctly and emits `replyIsReady`.

Actual Behavior:

* Crashes with out-of-bound access on response parsing.
* Reply content not properly stored or emitted.
* Debug output shows "Failed to open openai key config file" or "API key not found" even when the file exists.
* Authorization header not recognized.
* JSON object malformed due to variable mismatch.
