// Test Case 1: Loading skill explosion effect with incorrect skill ID variable
→ Setup: Trigger OnLoadComplete() with a defined skill ID
→ Expected Output: SkillConfigInfo is correctly retrieved
→ Actual Output: SkillConfigInfo is null or causes exception
// Suggests mismatch between used variable name and actual definition.


// Test Case 2: Explosion position misalignment in FixDistanceArea skill
→ Setup: SkillType == FixDistanceArea; check fixPosition assignment
→ Expected Output: Explosion appears aligned with target's vertical position
→ Actual Output: Explosion appears shifted horizontally
// Indicates position component assignment may be using wrong axis.


// Test Case 3: Default direction fallback for rotation
→ Setup: dir == Vector3.zero
→ Expected Output: Object retains previous rotation or applies neutral orientation
→ Actual Output: Unexpected behavior or lack of orientation
// Suggests default direction may not initialize as intended.
