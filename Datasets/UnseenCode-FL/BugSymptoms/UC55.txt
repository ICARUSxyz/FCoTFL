// Test Case 1: updateAQI(90.0)
→ Output:
Current AQI: 90.00, Fan Speed: 0  
Air quality is good. Operating at normal speed.  
// Expected normal speed (e.g., fanSpeed: 1), but shows fan is off.

// Test Case 2: updateAQI(150.0)
→ Output:
Current AQI: 150.00, Fan Speed: 2  
WARNING: Poor air quality. Increasing fan speed.  
// Behavior aligns with expectations in moderately polluted conditions.

// Test Case 3: updateAQI(220.0)
→ Output:
Current AQI: 220.00, Fan Speed: 0  
ALERT: Hazardous air quality detected! Take protective measures.  
// Message indicates danger, but fan remains off, which appears contradictory.

// Observation 1:
Default fan state at initialization may not reflect expected normal operation.

// Observation 2:
Under extreme pollution, alert is shown but fanSpeed remains at 0, potentially causing confusion.

// Observation 3:
Threshold comparison omits equality condition, which might affect triggering logic at boundary AQI values.
