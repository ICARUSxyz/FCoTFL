Bug Report: CodeHistory

Test Input:

```cpp
CodeHistory editor;
editor.show();
```

Observed Behavior:

* Compilation error: no matching function call to `setEditorFont(const char*)`.
* Runtime warning: `lineNumberAreaPaintEvent()` called with missing argument.
* Line numbers are not displayed correctly for documents with 10 or more lines.

Expected Behavior:

* Editor initializes with monospaced font (e.g., Courier, size 10).
* Line number area paints correctly alongside text.
* Line numbers adapt dynamically based on total line count.

Actual Behavior:

* Font initialization incomplete due to missing argument.
* Line number paint event causes runtime warning or visual artifacts.
* Line number area width does not increase at 10 lines, causing overlap or truncation.
