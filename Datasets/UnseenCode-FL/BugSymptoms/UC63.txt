// Test Case 1: Platform Spawn Position
→ Setup: Game running with spawner active
→ Expected Output: Platforms appear along varying X-axis positions
→ Actual Output: Platforms always spawn at the same X-axis, only Y-axis varies
// Indicates the wrong coordinate was randomized (Y instead of X).


// Test Case 2: Spike Platform Control
→ Setup: Index randomly returns 4 multiple times in succession
→ Expected Output: At most one spike platform appears, others are skipped
→ Actual Output: Some spike platforms are still skipped even if only one is generated
// The conditional check may be too aggressive, preventing valid spawns.
