// Test Case 1: Timer Display Formatting
→ Scene Start → Wait 9 seconds → Observe `timeScore` label
→ Expected: "09"
→ Actual: "9"
// Single-digit times displayed without leading zero, inconsistent visual format.

// Test Case 2: Game Over Handling
→ Trigger: player dies
→ Expected: game over UI appears, time stops
→ Actual: game over UI appears, time stops
// Behavior is consistent, though the use of integer time scale (0) instead of float (0f) may be noted in some engine configurations.
