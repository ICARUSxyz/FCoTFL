// Test Case 1: Startup with missing config
→ Input: null server object
→ Expected: "server object or config file has not created!" and graceful return
→ Actual: Server proceeds with initialization logic despite missing server, leading to runtime exceptions.

// Test Case 2: Server shutdown via SIGINT
→ Trigger: CTRL+C during runtime
→ Expected: server.dispose() called, process exits cleanly with success status
→ Actual: Process exits with code 1
// Indicates abnormal termination, potentially misleading for monitoring tools or supervisors.

// Test Case 3: Windows-specific shutdown command
→ Input message: 'SHUTDOWN'
→ Expected: Shutdown action triggered
→ Actual: Shutdown not triggered unless message uses strict equality format
// Minor mismatch in equality check prevents shutdown from executing as intended in Windows environments.
