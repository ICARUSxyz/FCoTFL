**Bug Report: Requirement Tree and UI Interaction Observations**

---

**Test Case 1: Retrieving Class Items from Tree**

**Action:**
User initiates an operation requiring all class-level nodes to be collected from the tree view.

**Expected:**
All top-level class nodes are retrieved and stored in a list.

**Observed:**
No items are retrieved. Operation appears to be skipped or stuck.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[BEGIN] Collecting class items  
[ERROR] Invalid loop condition, no iteration occurred  
[RESULT] Collected items: 0  
```

**Test Case 2: Extracting Tree Structure into Model**

**Action:**
User attempts to serialize the current tree view into a structured data format.

**Expected:**
Each class node and its associated child methods are properly extracted.

**Observed:**
Only the second child (or incorrect one) is repeatedly collected, resulting in incomplete or incorrect data mapping.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[BEGIN] Tree traversal for export  
[INFO] Found class node: "SampleClass"  
[ERROR] Accessed child at fixed index  
[RESULT] Collected methods: 1 (expected: 3)  
```

**Test Case 3: UI Option Switching – First Option Selected**

**Action:**
User selects the first radio option.

**Expected:**
Corresponding panel should be displayed correctly.

**Observed:**
An unexpected panel is shown instead.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INPUT] Option selected: 1  
[EXPECTED] View index: 0  
[ACTUAL] View index: 1  
```

**Test Case 4: UI Option Switching – Second Option Selected**

**Action:**
User selects the second radio option.

**Expected:**
Second panel should be activated and shown.

**Observed:**
An incorrect panel index is activated, causing display inconsistency.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INPUT] Option selected: 2  
[EXPECTED] View index: 1  
[ACTUAL] View index: 2  
```
