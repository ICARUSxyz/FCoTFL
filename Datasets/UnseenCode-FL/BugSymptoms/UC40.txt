**Bug Report: RadarChart Visualization â€“ Symptom Summary**

---

### **Test Case 1: Initialization and Display**

**Input:**

```java
int[] values = {60, 80, 50, 70, 90};
String[] labels = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"};
```

**Expected Behavior:**
A radar chart window is displayed showing five axes with values correctly plotted, labels aligned near each vertex, and the chart rendered proportionally within the panel.

**Observed Output:**

```
[Window appears, but chart elements are misaligned or incorrect]
- Radar polygon seems compressed or mis-scaled
- Labels appear offset from their expected positions
- Program fails to launch on some platforms with runtime error:
  > Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
  > EXIT_ON_CLOSE cannot be resolved to a variable
```

### **Test Case 2: Polygon Rendering**

**Observed Behavior:**

```
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: nPoints < 0
	at java.awt.Polygon.<init>(Polygon.java:84)
	at java.awt.Graphics.fillPolygon(Graphics.java:...)
```

### **Test Case 3: Label Positioning**

**Observed Behavior:**

```
Labels are drawn to the right of their expected positions.
Some labels appear overlapping or misaligned from the vertices.
```

### **Console Log (Simulated):**

```
[INFO] Launching radar chart window...
[INFO] Drawing chart with 5 points
[WARN] Label position adjustment may be inaccurate
[ERROR] Unresolved symbol: EXIT_ON_CLOSE
```
