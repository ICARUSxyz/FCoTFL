**Bug Report Summary: Charge GUI – Symptom Overview**

---

### **Test Case 1: Displaying Balance with HTML Formatting**

**Setup:**
A valid balance value (e.g., `"2000"`) is read from `balance.csv`.

**Input:**

```java
new charge();
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The balance is displayed in red using HTML formatting, e.g.:

```
balance : 2000 yen  ← (displayed in red)
```

**Observed Output:**

```
GUI rendering issue or HTML tag appears in plain text
balance : 2000 yen</font>
```

**Console Log (Simulated):**

```
Warning: HTML content may not render properly due to malformed markup.
```

### **Test Case 2: Charge Limit Range Miscalculation**

**Setup:**
User's balance is `"495000"`.

**Expected Range Output:**

```
min: -   max: -
(The maximum charge amount has been reached. You can't charge.)
```

**Observed Output (Before Fix):**

```
min: 1000   max: 5000
(No limit warning shown)
```

**Console Log (Simulated):**

```
Parsed balance: 495000
Charge range incorrectly calculated due to threshold misalignment
```

---

### **Test Case 3: Maximum Balance Check Threshold**

**Setup:**
Different values of balance are tested:

* **Case A: balance = 480000**

  * Output: min = 1000, max = 20000
  * No warning shown

* **Case B: balance = 500000**

  * Output: min = -, max = -
  * Warning shown: "The maximum charge amount has been reached..."

**Observed Problem:**
The cutoff value used for comparison does not consistently trigger the expected warning when balance is near the upper limit, leading to inconsistent or incorrect GUI behavior.
