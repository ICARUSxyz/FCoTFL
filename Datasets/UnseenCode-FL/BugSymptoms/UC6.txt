Bug Report: SuggestionDialog

Test Input:

```cpp
SuggestionDialog dialog;
dialog.show();
```

Observed Behavior:

* Application fails to compile due to signal-slot connection syntax error.
* Clicking the "Generate" button on the "Annotation" tab causes no response.
* Clicking the button in any tab opens a blank page in the default browser.

Expected Behavior:

* Code compiles successfully.
* "Generate" button copies the correct tab content to clipboard and opens ChatGPT.
* Each tab behaves consistently upon button click.

Actual Behavior:

* Compile-time error due to incorrect signal syntax.
* Annotation tab content not processed due to missing break.
* URL fails to open ChatGPT correctly because of missing scheme (`https://`).
