// Test Case 1: Null Transform Reference
→ Setup: mTransform is uninitialized
→ Action: Call GetTransform()
→ Expected: mTransform is assigned to gameObject.transform
→ Actual: System.NullReferenceException or incorrect behavior due to assignment in condition

// Test Case 2: Dynamic building optimization not skipped
→ Setup: useOptimizeDynamicBuild is true
→ Action: Call RefreshFrustumPlanes()
→ Expected: Frustum planes should be updated
→ Actual: Method returns early; planes remain outdated

// Test Case 3: Camera position computation
→ Setup: Camera follows a target at position (10, 0, 10)
→ Action: Update camera position via FixedUpdatePosition()
→ Expected: Camera moves behind target based on rotation and distance
→ Actual: Camera moves in wrong direction or to unexpected position

// Log Output Simulation:
→ [Error] update more than once in one frame!
→ [Warning] Frustum planes not refreshed due to optimization flag
→ [Exception] mTransform is null reference
→ [Debug] Camera moved to (5.3, 65, 15.1)
