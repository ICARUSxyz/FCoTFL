// Test Case 1: File path logging when EAN file is missing
→ Setup: Provide a nonexistent file path to ReadInfoFromFile()
→ Expected Output: Debug.LogError displays the full path string
→ Actual Output: Compilation error or log formatting issue
// String concatenation missing '+' in logging statement


// Test Case 2: Map data loading using constructed path string
→ Setup: Call GetMapDataById() with a map ID
→ Expected Output: Path is constructed as "Assets/Resources/Map/1.map"
→ Actual Output: File not found or incorrect file path
// File extension or path format mismatch prevents file loading


// Test Case 3: Reading map data entries
→ Setup: Load map data from binary file with width * height entries
→ Expected Output: Loop reads all entries and populates MapData accordingly
→ Actual Output: Exception or extra byte read beyond expected size
// Iteration bounds include one excess read, possibly causing overflow
