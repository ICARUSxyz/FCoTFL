// Test Case 1: Effect Initialization with Valid Start and End
→ Setup: Call createAbsorbEffect(owner, startObject, endObject)
→ Expected Output: Effect spawns at startObject’s position and moves toward endObject
→ Actual Output: Effect spawns at world origin or incorrect location
// Suggests that the effect does not properly use startObject’s position.


// Test Case 2: Effect Movement Toward End Object
→ Setup: Let effect run for its full duration (e.g., 2 seconds)
→ Expected Output: Effect moves from start to end smoothly and disappears
→ Actual Output: Effect veers away or behaves erratically during movement
// Indicates potential miscalculation in movement vector direction.


// Test Case 3: Effect Duration
→ Setup: Let effect play and observe timing
→ Expected Output: Effect lasts exactly 2 seconds before destruction
→ Actual Output: Effect ends noticeably earlier or later
// Timing constant may not match expected value.
