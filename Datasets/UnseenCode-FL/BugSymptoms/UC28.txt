**Bug Report: ScreenFactor Calculation Anomalies**

---

**Test Case 1: DPI-Based UI Scaling**

**Action:**
Launch UI on different monitors with varying DPI and observe scaling.

**Expected:**
UI elements scale proportionally based on logical DPI and pixel ratio.

**Observed:**
Scaling appears inconsistent across devices. Some elements are disproportionately large or small.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INIT] Primary screen DPI: 120  
[INFO] Scaling base value: 90  
[WARN] Scaling factor exceeds expected bounds  
[RESULT] UI rendered with abnormal element size
```

---

**Test Case 2: Screen Factor Calculation**

**Action:**
Call `getScreenFactor()` during UI initialization.

**Expected:**
A meaningful factor is returned based on both DPI and pixel ratio.

**Observed:**
Returned value is unexpectedly large or zero; layout shifts occur.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[CALL] getScreenFactor()  
[INFO] logicalDPI: 120  
[INFO] devicePixelRatio: 2.0  
[ERROR] ratioVal undefined  
[WARN] screenFactor = 240.0 (unexpected)
```
