updateGreenTime(134)
→ Output:
invalide input	
(no new log recorded)

// Observation 1: Incorrect condition evaluation
→ Output always prints "invalide input" regardless of actual greenTime update

// Observation 2: Missing % symbol in log message
→ Log entry: (Traffic: 62) instead of (Traffic: 62%)

// Observation 3: Initial greenTime inconsistent with expectation
→ Instantiated with 20, while scenario assumes default is 15
