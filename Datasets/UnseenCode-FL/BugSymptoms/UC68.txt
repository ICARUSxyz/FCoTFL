// Test Case 1: Creating a local player entity
→ Input: sGUID belongs to local user
→ Expected: Local player entity created with correct team type
→ Actual: Player entity initialized with undefined or incorrect type

// Test Case 2: Adding player to AccountDic
→ Input: Attempt to add existing sGUID again
→ Expected: Log shows "Has the same Guid: [GUID]"
→ Actual: Log shows message without expected wording, causing miscommunication

// Test Case 3: Setting collider radius based on config
→ Input: Hero with HeroCollideRadious = 100
→ Expected: entity.ColliderRadius == 10
→ Actual: entity.ColliderRadius == 10 (corrected from originally too large value)

// Test Case 4: Cleaning account dictionary
→ Input: AccountDic has N entries
→ Expected: All non-local players are removed (loop includes index 0)
→ Actual: First entry potentially skipped; loop does not cover i == 0
