**Bug Report: BuildProFromSpecDialog Functionality Observations**

---

**Test Case 1: Class Selection for Demotion**

**Action:**
User attempts to demote a function into a selected class via dialog interaction.

**Expected:**
After selecting a valid class, the function is moved under the chosen class node.

**Observed:**
Even when the user cancels the dialog, the demotion proceeds, possibly leading to misplacement.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INPUT] Dialog result: Cancelled  
[LOGIC] Demotion still applied  
[ACTION] Function moved under class: "ExampleClass"  
```

**Test Case 2: Creating a New Class**

**Action:**
User adds a new class node to the tree structure.

**Expected:**
The new class node is editable and not mistaken as imported or locked.

**Observed:**
Newly created class nodes behave as if they are from an external source and cannot be modified.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[ACTION] Created class "NewClass"  
[STATUS] Modifiable: false  
[CHECK] Skipped in edit due to external flag  
```

**Test Case 3: Renaming a Tree Item**

**Action:**
User renames a function or class from the UI tree.

**Expected:**
The selected item is updated with the new name and remains selected.

**Observed:**
After renaming, the current selection disappears or resets.

**Log:**
\[INPUT] Rename "OldName" â†’ "NewName"

```plaintext
[ACTION] Item renamed successfully  
[UI] Selection lost after rename  
[ERROR] setCurrentItem() called with no argument  
```

---

**Test Case 4: Deleting an Item**

**Action:**
User tries to delete an item without selecting anything.

**Expected:**
A message prompts the user and safely exits the operation.

**Observed:**
The application attempts to return a value where none is expected, leading to build warnings or errors.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[UI] No item selected for deletion  
[INFO] MessageBox shown to user  
[ERROR] Invalid return statement encountered  
```
