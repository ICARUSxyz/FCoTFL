// Test Case 1: XML file with correct root node
→ Input: XML content begins with <SkillCfg_area>
→ Expected: Configuration entries parsed and loaded into dictionary
→ Actual: No entries processed due to incorrect node match or missing data

// Test Case 2: XML entry missing "un32ID" attribute
→ Input: <Skill id="..."> without un32ID attribute
→ Expected: Skipped entry
→ Actual: Program throws exception or fails silently due to invalid condition check

// Test Case 3: Adding skill configuration to dictionary
→ Input: skillinfo object populated with correct data
→ Expected: Dictionary entry added with key = skillinfo.id, value = skillinfo
→ Actual: Dictionary value mistakenly stored as an integer (id) instead of full config object

// Simulated Log Output:
→ [Error] Failed to parse XML node: missing 'un32ID' attribute
→ [Warning] Root node <SkillCfg_area > not found
→ [Info] Added skill config: ID=1001, Name="Explosion"
