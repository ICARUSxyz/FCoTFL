**Bug Report: Video Recording and Storage Anomalies**

---

**Test Case 1: Configure Video Settings**

**Action:**
Invoke `configureVideoSettings()` before starting recording.

**Expected:**
Video configuration is applied with valid parameters (e.g., integer frame rate).

**Observed:**
Compilation fails or runtime exception due to invalid frame rate syntax.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[ERROR] Invalid argument '30fps' passed to setFrameRate()
[FAIL] Video settings not applied
```

---

**Test Case 2: Recorder Initialization Failure**

**Action:**
Trigger `startRecording()` without resolving dependencies.

**Expected:**
Recorder fails gracefully with clear error output to standard error.

**Observed:**
Error message printed to standard output instead of standard error.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Starting video recording...
[ERROR] VideoRecorder instance could not be created.  // Printed to stdout
```

---

**Test Case 3: Recording Completion Message**

**Action:**
Call `stopRecording()` after a successful recording session.

**Expected:**
Message confirms recording stopped and file path is shown.

**Observed:**
Output message format inconsistent with user expectation.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Recording stopped. File saved: /videos/output_20250808.enc
```

---

**Test Case 4: Encrypted Storage Operation**

**Action:**
Call `encryptAndStoreVideo()` with video data.

**Expected:**
Encrypted data is written to secure storage path.

**Observed:**
Plain video data is written instead of encrypted content.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INFO] Encrypting video data...
[INFO] Writing file: /encrypted/output_20250808.enc
[WARN] Written content is not encrypted
```
