Bug Report: SuggestionDialog

Test Input:

```cpp
SuggestionDialog dialog;
dialog.show();
```

Observed Behavior:

* Application crashes during UI setup.
* No widgets are displayed inside the dialog.
* Button text appears blank or causes compile error.

Expected Behavior:

* Dialog initializes with three functional tabs: Code Generation, Code Refinement, and Code Annotation.
* The "Generate" button appears correctly and is clickable.
* All layouts are applied properly, and widgets are visible.

Actual Behavior:

* Button construction fails due to incorrect usage of `Generate` identifier.
* Annotation tab layout appears misaligned.
* Final layout not applied as expected â€” widgets do not render inside main window.
