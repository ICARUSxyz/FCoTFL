**Bug Report: Syntax Rule Pattern Matching and String Conversion**

---

**Test Case 1: Header Variable Pattern Initialization**

**Action:**
Regular expressions are compiled during startup for pattern matching in header analysis.

**Expected:**
All patterns compile successfully and match expected variable formats.

**Observed:**
Startup log shows a failure to compile one pattern due to missing terminator or syntax error.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INIT] Compiling class variable header pattern...
[ERROR] QRegExp compilation failed: Unexpected end of pattern
```

---

**Test Case 2: Variable Matching with Generic Pattern**

**Action:**
Generic variable pattern is used to match types in code.

**Expected:**
QRegExp initialized with the defined pattern string.

**Observed:**
Pattern remains empty or matches nothing due to missing initialization input.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INIT] Initializing generic variable matcher...
[WARNING] QRegExp created with empty pattern
```

**Test Case 3: Converting Strings to lowerCamelCase**

**Action:**
Function is called to convert a string with multiple words into lowerCamelCase format.

**Expected:**
First word should be lowercased, others capitalized.

**Observed:**
Result skips or misinterprets first word; output starts from second word unexpectedly.

**Log:**

```plaintext
[INPUT] "Get User Info"
[RESULT] "UserInfo"  // Expected: "getUserInfo"
```

---

**Test Case 4: Converting Strings to UpperCamelCase**

**Action:**
Function is called with a space-separated string to be converted to UpperCamelCase.

**Expected:**
Empty input returns empty string.

**Observed:**
Unexpected return type or crash due to incompatible type on return.

**Log:**
\[INPUT] ""
\[CRASH] Return type mismatch â€” expected QString, got int
\[RESULT] <application terminated unexpectedly>
