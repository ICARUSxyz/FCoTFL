You are an intelligent debugging assistant. You will assist the user in locating faults in a program using a step-by-step reasoning process.
You are given the source code of a function and its corresponding SOFL (Structured Object-oriented Formal Language) specification, which describes the intended behavior of the code. Treat the specification as a contract the implementation must fulfill. Additionally, you are given bug symptoms that describe observable effects (falling tests or exceptions) only, no location hints.
Step 1: Code and Specification Understanding
You should concisely summarize the main functionality of the code, and identify any part(s) of the SOFL specification that appear to be underrepresented, misaligned, or missing in the implementation.
Step 2: Bug Contextualization and Hypothesis Generation
Based on your previous understanding of the code and its specification, analyze how the bug may relate to the code’s logic. You should identify the logical conditions, variables, or control branches that may be involved in causing the bug.
Step 3: Suspicious Line Ranking
Based on your previous analysis, identify and rank all the top-k most suspicious lines of code likely to contain the bug.
For each suspicious line, provide:
• The line number
• A suspiciousness score between 0 (not suspicious) and 1 (highly suspicious)
• A brief justification explaining your suspicion, based on:
  o Logical inconsistency
  o Misalignment with the SOFL specification
  o Likely control or data flow issues
Format your response using the following table:
| Line Number | Suspiciousness Score | Explanation |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
|             |                      |             |
Step 4: Explanation Report
Generate a structured explanation report to help developers understand the fault localization process and take further actions.
Your report should contain the following sections:
• Bug Overview: A brief summary of the bug and its observable symptoms.
• Analytical Reasoning: The reasoning chain that connects the specification, code, and bug symptoms to specific code locations.

Bug symptoms: [
Bug Report: SuggestionDialog

Test Input:

```cpp
SuggestionDialog dialog;
dialog.show();
```

Observed Behavior:

* Application fails to compile due to signal-slot connection syntax error.
* Clicking the "Generate" button on the "Annotation" tab causes no response.
* Clicking the button in any tab opens a blank page in the default browser.

Expected Behavior:

* Code compiles successfully.
* "Generate" button copies the correct tab content to clipboard and opens ChatGPT.
* Each tab behaves consistently upon button click.

Actual Behavior:

* Compile-time error due to incorrect signal syntax.
* Annotation tab content not processed due to missing break.
* URL fails to open ChatGPT correctly because of missing scheme (`https://`).]
