You are an intelligent debugging assistant. You will assist the user in locating faults in a program using a step-by-step reasoning process.
You are given the source code of a function and its corresponding SOFL (Structured Object-oriented Formal Language) specification, which describes the intended behavior of the code. Treat the specification as a contract the implementation must fulfill. Additionally, you are given bug symptoms that describe observable effects (falling tests or exceptions) only, no location hints.
Step 1: Code and Specification Understanding
You should concisely summarize the main functionality of the code, and identify any part(s) of the SOFL specification that appear to be underrepresented, misaligned, or missing in the implementation.
Step 2: Bug Contextualization and Hypothesis Generation
Based on your previous understanding of the code and its specification, analyze how the bug may relate to the code’s logic. You should identify the logical conditions, variables, or control branches that may be involved in causing the bug.
Step 3: Suspicious Line Ranking
Based on your previous analysis, identify and rank all the top-k most suspicious lines of code likely to contain the bug.
For each suspicious line, provide:
• The line number
• A suspiciousness score between 0 (not suspicious) and 1 (highly suspicious)
• A brief justification explaining your suspicion, based on:
  o Logical inconsistency
  o Misalignment with the SOFL specification
  o Likely control or data flow issues
Format your response using the following table:
| Line Number | Suspiciousness Score | Explanation |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
|             |                      |             |
Step 4: Explanation Report
Generate a structured explanation report to help developers understand the fault localization process and take further actions.
Your report should contain the following sections:
• Bug Overview: A brief summary of the bug and its observable symptoms.
• Analytical Reasoning: The reasoning chain that connects the specification, code, and bug symptoms to specific code locations.

Bug symptoms: [
// Test Case 1: BeatFly is triggered when character is already in motion
→ Setup: Call BeatFly(...) while mEnable is already true and mCanBeRecover is 0
→ Expected Output: No effect is applied; previous state is preserved
→ Actual Output: Effect state is unexpectedly reset or overwritten
// Indicates recovery logic may not work as intended.


// Test Case 2: BeatFly initializes with null animation component
→ Setup: Call BeatFly(...) on GameObject with no Animation component attached
→ Expected Output: Null check handles absence gracefully
→ Actual Output: NullReferenceException or animation call fails silently
// Suggests null-check on animation component may be ineffective.


// Test Case 3: Stay time set to 0
→ Setup: Call BeatFly(...) with stayTime = 0
→ Expected Output: System auto-corrects to a minimal non-zero value
→ Actual Output: Character falls immediately or remains floating
// Stay duration correction may not be functioning.


// Test Case 4: Direction check for playing animation
→ Setup: Call BeatFly(...) with action != "0"
→ Expected Output: No animation is played
→ Actual Output: Animation unexpectedly plays or fails
// Action comparison may not behave logically as expected.


// Test Case 5: Position capture for vertical motion
→ Setup: Call BeatFly(...) and check mDefaultHeigt
→ Expected Output: Stores character's current vertical position
→ Actual Output: Stores horizontal (X-axis) position instead
// Motion origin may be incorrectly initialized.]
